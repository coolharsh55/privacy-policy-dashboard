            <h4><a name="sec2"></a>3. SHARING & DISCLOSURE</h4>
            <h5>3.1 With Your Consent. </h5>
            <p>Where you have provided consent, we share your information, including personal information, as described at the time of consent, such as when you authorize a third party application or website to access your Airbnb Account or when you participate in promotional activities conducted by Airbnb partners or third parties. </p>
            <h5>3.2 Sharing between Members. </h5>
            <p>To help facilitate bookings or other interactions between Members, we may need to share certain information, including personal information, with other Members, as it is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us, as follows:   </p>
            <ul>
                <li>When you as a Guest submit a booking request, certain information about you is shared with the Host (and Co-Host, if applicable), including your full name, the full name of any additional Guests, your cancellation history, and other information you agree to share. When your booking is confirmed, we will disclose additional information to assist with coordinating the trip, like your phone number. </li>
                <li>When you as a Host (or Co-Host, if applicable) have a confirmed booking, certain information is shared with the Guest to coordinate the booking, such as your full name, phone number, and Accommodation or Experience address.  </li>
                <li>When you as a Host invite another Member to become a Co-Host, you authorize the Co-Host to access your information and Member Content, including but not limited to certain information like your full name, phone number, Accommodation address, and email address.</li>
                <li>When you as a Guest invite additional Guests to a booking, your full name, travel dates, Host name, Listing details, the Accommodation address, and other related information will be shared with each additional Guest.</li>
                <li>When you as a Guest initiate a Group Payment Booking Request certain information about each participant such as first name, last initial, profile picture as well as the booking details is shared among all participants of the Group Payment Booking Request.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We don’t share your billing and payout information with other Members.  </p>
            <h5>3.3 Profiles, Listings, and other Public Information. </h5>
            <p>The Airbnb Platform lets you publish information, including personal information, that is visible to the general public. For example: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Parts of your public profile page, such as your first name, your description, and city, are publicly visible to others.</li>
                <li>Listing pages are publicly visible and include information such as the Accommodation or Experience’s approximate location (neighborhood and city) or precise location (where you have provided your consent), Listing description, calendar availability, your public profile photo, aggregated demand information (like page views over a period of time), and any additional information you choose to share. </li>
                <li>After completing a booking, Guests and Hosts may write Reviews and rate each other. Reviews and Ratings are a part of your public profile page and may also be surfaced elsewhere on the Airbnb Platform (such as the Listing page). </li>
                <li>If you submit content in a community or discussion forum, blog or social media post, or use a similar feature on the Airbnb Platform, that content is publicly visible.  </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Based on our legitimate interest to promote the Airbnb Platform we may display parts of the Airbnb Platform (e.g., your Listing page) on sites operated by Airbnb’s business partners, using technologies such as widgets or APIs. If your Listings are displayed on a partner’s site, information from your public profile page may also be displayed. </p>
            <p>Information you share publicly on the Airbnb Platform may be indexed through third party search engines. In some cases, you may opt-out of this feature in your Account settings. If you change your settings or your public-facing content, these search engines may not update their databases. We do not control the practices of third party search engines, and they may use caches containing your outdated information. </p>
            <h5>3.4 Additional Services by Hosts. </h5>
            <p>Hosts may need to use third party services available through the Airbnb Platform to assist with managing their Accommodation or providing additional services requested by you, such as cleaning services or lock providers. Hosts may use features on the Airbnb Platform to share information about the Guest (like check-in and check-out dates, Guest name, Guest phone number) with such third party service providers for the purposes of coordinating the stay, managing the Accommodation, or providing other services.</p>
            <h5>3.5 Compliance with Law, Responding to Legal Requests, Preventing Harm and Protection of our Rights. </h5>
            <p>Airbnb and Airbnb Payments may disclose your information, including personal information, to courts, law enforcement or governmental authorities, or authorized third parties, if and to the extent we are required or permitted to do so by law or if such disclosure is reasonably necessary: (i) comply with our legal obligations, (ii) to comply with legal process and to respond to claims asserted against Airbnb, (iii) to respond to verified requests relating to a criminal investigation or alleged or suspected illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other of our users to legal liability, (iv) to enforce and administer our Terms of Service, the Payment Terms or <a href="/terms">o</a>t<a href="/terms">h</a>e<a href="/terms">r</a> agreements with Members, or (v) to protect the rights, property or personal safety of Airbnb, its employees, its Members, or members of the public. </p>
            <p>Where appropriate, we may notify Members about legal requests unless: (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law, or (ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon Airbnb’s property, its Members and the Airbnb Platform. In instances where we comply with legal requests without notice for these reasons, we will attempt to notify that Member about the request after the fact where appropriate and where we determine in good faith that we are no longer prevented from doing so.</p>
            <h5>3.6 Service Providers. </h5>

            <h4><a name="sec3"></a>4. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION </h4>
            <h5>4.1 Analyzing your Communications. </h5>
            <p>We may review, scan, or analyze your communications on the Airbnb Platform for fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research, and customer support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention efforts, we scan and analyze messages to mask contact information and references to other websites. In some cases, we may also scan, review, or analyze messages to debug, improve, and expand product offerings. We use automated methods where reasonably possible. However, occasionally we may need to manually review some communications, such as for fraud investigations and customer support, or to assess and improve the functionality of these automated tools. We will not review, scan, or analyze your communications to send third party marketing messages to you, and we will not sell reviews or analyses of these communications. </p>
            <p>These activities are carried out based on Airbnb's legitimate interest in ensuring compliance with applicable laws and our Terms, preventing fraud, promoting safety, and improving and ensuring the adequate performance of our services.</p>
            <h5>4.2 Linking Third Party Accounts. </h5>

                <li>other Airbnb users may be able to see any schools, hometowns or other groups you have in common with them as listed on your linked social networking service;</li>
                <li>the information you provide to us from the linking of your accounts may be stored, processed and transmitted for fraud prevention and risk assessment purposes; and</li>

            </ul>

            <h4><a name="sec4"></a>5. THIRD PARTY PARTNERS & INTEGRATIONS </h4>
            <p>The Airbnb Platform may contain links to third party websites or services, such as third party integrations, co-branded services, or third party-branded services (“<strong>Third Party Partners</strong>”). Airbnb doesn’t own or control these Third Party Partners and when you interact with them, you may be providing information directly to the Third Party Partner, Airbnb, or both. These Third Party Partners will have their own rules about the collection, use, and disclosure of information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of the other websites you visit. </p>
            <h4><a name="sec5"></a>6. YOUR RIGHTS </h4>
            <p>You may exercise any of the rights described in this section before your applicable Airbnb Data Controller and Payments Data Controller by sending an email to <a href="mailto:dpo@airbnb.com">dpo@airbnb.com</a>. Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before taking further action on your request. </p>
            <h5>6.1 Managing Your Information. </h5>
            <p>You may access and update some of your information through your Account settings. If you have chosen to connect your Airbnb Account to a third-party application, like Facebook or Google, you can change your settings and remove permission for the app by changing your Account settings. You are responsible for keeping your personal information up-to-date.</p>
            <h5>6.2 Rectification of Inaccurate or Incomplete Information.</h5>
            <p>You have the right to ask us to correct inaccurate or incomplete personal information concerning you (and which you cannot update yourself within your Airbnb Account).</p>
            <h5>6.3 Data Access and Portability.</h5>
            <p>In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to request copies of your personal information held by us. You may also be entitled to request copies of personal information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and/or request us to transmit this information to another service provider (where technically feasible). </p>
            <h5>6.4 Data Retention and Erasure. </h5>
            <p>We generally retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us and to comply with our legal obligations. If you no longer want us to use your information to provide the Airbnb Platform to you, you can request that we erase your personal information and close your Airbnb Account. Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>We may retain some of your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety. For example, if we suspend an Airbnb Account for fraud or safety reasons, we may retain certain information from that Airbnb Account to prevent that Member from opening a new Airbnb Account in the future.</li>
                <li>We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, Airbnb and Airbnb Payments may keep some of your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations. </li>
                <li>Information you have shared with others (e.g., Reviews, forum postings) may continue to be publicly visible on the Airbnb Platform, even after your Airbnb Account is cancelled. However, attribution of such information to you will be removed. Additionally, some copies of your information (e.g., log records) may remain in our database, but are disassociated from personal identifiers. </li>
                <li>Because we maintain the Airbnb Platform to protect from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>6.5 Withdrawing Consent and Restriction of Processing.</h5>
            <p>Where you have provided your consent to the processing of your personal information by Airbnb you may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your Account settings or by sending a communication to Airbnb specifying which consent you are withdrawing. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to limit the ways in which we use your personal information, in particular where (i) you contest the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information; (iii) we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to the processing pursuant to Section 6.6 and pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of Airbnb override your own.</p>
            <h5>6.6 Objection to Processing.</h5>
            <p>In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to require Airbnb and Airbnb Payments not to process your personal information for certain specific purposes (including profiling) where such processing is based on legitimate interest. If you object to such processing Airbnb and/or Airbnb Payments will no longer process your personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. </p>
            <p>Where your personal information is processed for direct marketing purposes, you may, at any time ask Airbnb to cease processing your data for these direct marketing purposes by sending an e-mail to opt-out@airbnb.com.</p>

Laws in these countries may differ from the laws applicable to your Country of Residence. For example, information collected within the EEA may be transferred, stored, and processed outside of the EEA for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Where we transfer store, and process your personal information outside of the EEA we have ensured that appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure an adequate level of data protection.  </p>
            <h5>7.1 EU-US & Swiss-US Privacy Shield.  </h5>
            <p>Airbnb and Airbnb Payments comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.

If you have any questions or concerns relating to our Privacy Shield certification, contact us at Airbnb, Inc., Legal Department, 888 Brannan Street, San Francisco, CA 94103 or via <a href="mailto:privacyshield@airbnb.com">email</a>. If we are not able to resolve your concern, you may also contact your European Data Protection Authority or Commission or seek assistance from our designated Privacy Shield independent recourse mechanism, <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/">JAMS</a>. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to pursue binding arbitration through the Privacy Shield Framework, as described in <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction">Annex I to the Privacy Shield Principles</a>. </p>
            <p>If we have received your personal information under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfer it to a third party service provider for processing as described in this Privacy Policy, we will remain responsible if these providers process your personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, except where we can establish that Airbnb or Airbnb Payments was not responsible for the violation.</p>
            <h5>7.2 Other Means to Ensure an Adequate Level of Data Protection.</h5>
            <p>If Airbnb Ireland is the Data Controller and your information is shared with corporate affiliates or third party service providers outside the EEA, we have - prior to sharing your information with such corporate affiliate or third party service provider – established the necessary means to ensure an adequate level of data protection. This may be an adequacy decision of the European Commission confirming an adequate level of data protection in the respective non-EEA country or an agreement on the basis of the EU Model Clauses (a set of clauses issued by the European Commission). We will provide further information on the means to ensure an adequate level of data protection on request.</p>
            <h5>7.3 California & Vermont Residents. </h5>
            <p>Airbnb Payments will not share information it collects about you with its affiliates or third parties (both financial and non-financial), except as required or permitted by your state’s law. </p>
            <h5>7.4 California Privacy Rights.</h5>
            <p>California law permits Members who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personal information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of personal information disclosed to those third parties. See the “Contact” section for where to send such requests. Airbnb and Airbnb Payments do not share personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes without your prior consent. Accordingly, you can prevent disclosure of your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes by withholding consent.</p>
            <h4><a name="sec7"></a>8. SECURITY </h4>
            <p>We are continuously implementing and updating administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your information against unauthorized access, loss, destruction, or alteration.

            <p>Last Updated: June 19, 2017</p>

            <p>Thank you for using Airbnb!</p>

            <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, process, and disclose your information across the Airbnb Platform.</p>

            <p>If you see an undefined term in this Privacy Policy (such as “Listing” or “Airbnb Platform”), it has the same definition as outlined in our <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

            <p>When this policy mentions “Airbnb,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” it refers to the Airbnb company that is responsible for your information under this Privacy Policy (the “<strong>Data Controller</strong>”).</p>

            <ul><li>If you reside in the United States, the Data Controller is Airbnb, Inc.</li><li>If you reside outside of the United States and the People’s Republic of China (for purposes of this Privacy Policy, the People’s Republic of China does not include Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) (“<strong>China</strong>”), the Data Controller is Airbnb Ireland UC (“<strong>Airbnb Ireland</strong>”).</li><li>If you reside in China, the Data Controller is Airbnb Internet (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (“<strong>Airbnb China</strong>”), except where you book a Host Service or create a Listing located outside of China, in which case, the Data Controller is Airbnb Ireland for that transaction. Additionally, Airbnb Ireland will be the Data Controller for all bookings confirmed prior to December 7, 2016 at 10:00am UTC.</li></ul>

            <p>If you change your place of residence, the Data Controller will be determined by your new place of residence as specified above, from the date on which your place of residence changes.</p>

            <p>This Privacy Policy also applies to the Payment Services provided to you by Airbnb Payments pursuant to the <a href="/terms/payments_terms">Payments Terms of Service</a> (“<strong>Payments Terms</strong>”). One or more Airbnb Payments entities will be the Data Controller of your information related to the Payment Services depending on where your Payment Method or Payout Method is issued:</p>

            <ul><li>If issued in the United States, the Data Controller is Airbnb Payments, Inc. (a subsidiary of Airbnb, Inc.).</li><li>If issued in China, the Data Controller is Airbnb China, except if: (i) you book or create a Listing outside of China, (ii) book a Listing in China with a Host who is not a resident of China, or (iii) the booking was confirmed prior to December 7, 2016 at 10:00am UTC, in which case the Data Controller is Airbnb Payments UK Ltd.</li><li>If issued in India, the Data Controller is Airbnb Payments India Pvt. Ltd., except if you use a Payout Method issued in India and accept a booking from a Guest with a Payment Method that is not issued in India, in which case the Data Controller is Airbnb Payments UK Ltd.</li><li>If issued outside of the United States, China, and India, the Data Controller is Airbnb Payments UK Ltd.</li></ul>
